# GMX Vault Calculator

## Usage

Add the folder ./input/private yourself with the following files:
- private_address.txt with your private address.
- api.txt with your web3 HTTPProvider (I use [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/))

## Purpose

This is my first web3 application, so the main goal for now is to get exposure to web3.py.
This repo will start out by just calculating the net GLP exposure for a given address, broken down in the underlying assets.

## Future

In the future, a few applications might be added.

### Hedge Backtest

Calculate a hedge for the directional components of GLP and a way to backtest the hedge.


### Automated trading

Determine trading decisions based on the hedge, and automate them.
